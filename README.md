# InfoViz_ScatterPlots
This is the project related to Scatter Plots. My hypothesis is How Data Label and Scale change the speed of comprehension in scatter plot.
how the persuasion on the scatter plot changes when additional dimension is added as a data label in the graph. 
how the scatter plot can show the data story more effectively when it is presented to non-technical audience.
